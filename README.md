# 🧟 CryptoZombies Battle Game NFT

🎮 [https://cryptozombiesbattle.com](https://cryptozombiesbattle.com)

This game was born out of a desire for knowledge and hands-on learning. It started after I completed the [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) course, which inspired me to turn the concepts I learned into a real, functional project.

The project is **open source**, with the goal of promoting transparency and giving others the opportunity to learn, explore the code, and see how a course can evolve into a production-level project.

The game's **small fees exist solely to cover server costs** and keep the project online. None of the fees are for personal profit — the focus here is on learning, building, and sharing.

🎮 **Play, explore the game, keep the marketplace active, and share it with the community!**

❤️ Special thanks to **CryptoZombies** for the knowledge foundation that made all of this possible.
